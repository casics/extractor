How to enable VoIP relaying on your Home Server with TURN

Overview
--------
The synapse Matrix Home Server supports integration with TURN server via the
TURN server REST API
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00). This allows
the Home Server to generate credentials that are valid for use on the TURN
server through the use of a secret shared between the Home Server and the
TURN server.

This document described how to install coturn
(https://code.google.com/p/coturn/) which also supports the TURN REST API,
and integrate it with synapse.

coturn Setup
============

 1. Check out coturn::
      svn checkout http://coturn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ coturn
      cd coturn

 2. Configure it::
      ./configure

    You may need to install libevent2: if so, you should do so
    in the way recommended by your operating system.
    You can ignore warnings about lack of database support: a
    database is unnecessary for this purpose.

 3. Build and install it::
      make
      make install

 4. Make a config file in /etc/turnserver.conf. You can customise
    a config file from turnserver.conf.default. The relevant
    lines, with example values, are::

      lt-cred-mech
      use-auth-secret
      static-auth-secret=[your secret key here]
      realm=turn.myserver.org

    See turnserver.conf.default for explanations of the options.
    One way to generate the static-auth-secret is with pwgen::

       pwgen -s 64 1

 5. Ensure youe firewall allows traffic into the TURN server on
    the ports you've configured it to listen on (remember to allow
    both TCP and UDP if you've enabled both).

 6. If you've configured coturn to support TLS/DTLS, generate or
    import your private key and certificate.

 7. Start the turn server::
       bin/turnserver -o


synapse Setup
=============

Your home server configuration file needs the following extra keys:

 1. "turn_uris": This needs to be a yaml list
    of public-facing URIs for your TURN server to be given out 
    to your clients. Add separate entries for each transport your
    TURN server supports.

 2. "turn_shared_secret": This is the secret shared between your Home
    server and your TURN server, so you should set it to the same
    string you used in turnserver.conf.

 3. "turn_user_lifetime": This is the amount of time credentials
    generated by your Home Server are valid for (in milliseconds).
    Shorter times offer less potential for abuse at the expense
    of increased traffic between web clients and your home server
    to refresh credentials. The TURN REST API specification recommends
    one day (86400000).

As an example, here is the relevant section of the config file for
matrix.org::

    turn_uris: turn:turn.matrix.org:3478?transport=udp,turn:turn.matrix.org:3478?transport=tcp
    turn_shared_secret: n0t4ctuAllymatr1Xd0TorgSshar3d5ecret4obvIousreAsons
    turn_user_lifetime: 86400000

Now, restart synapse::

    cd /where/you/run/synapse
    ./synctl restart

...and your Home Server now supports VoIP relaying!
