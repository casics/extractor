Basically, PEP8

- NEVER tabs. 4 spaces to indent.
- Max line width: 79 chars (with flexibility to overflow by a "few chars" if
  the overflowing content is not semantically significant and avoids an
  explosion of vertical whitespace).
- Use camel case for class and type names
- Use underscores for functions and variables.
- Use double quotes.
- Use parentheses instead of '\\' for line continuation where ever possible
  (which is pretty much everywhere)
- There should be max a single new line between:
    - statements
    - functions in a class
- There should be two new lines between:
    - definitions in a module (e.g., between different classes)
- There should be spaces where spaces should be and not where there shouldn't be:
    - a single space after a comma
    - a single space before and after for '=' when used as assignment
    - no spaces before and after for '=' for default values and keyword arguments.
- Indenting must follow PEP8; either hanging indent or multiline-visual indent
  depending on the size and shape of the arguments and what makes more sense to
  the author. In other words, both this::

    print("I am a fish %s" % "moo")

  and this::

    print("I am a fish %s" %
          "moo")

  and this::

    print(
        "I am a fish %s" %
        "moo"
    )

  ...are valid, although given each one takes up 2x more vertical space than
  the previous, it's up to the author's discretion as to which layout makes most
  sense for their function invocation.  (e.g. if they want to add comments
  per-argument, or put expressions in the arguments, or group related arguments
  together, or want to deliberately extend or preserve vertical/horizontal
  space)

Comments should follow the google code style. This is so that we can generate
documentation with sphinx (http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) 

Code should pass pep8 --max-line-length=100 without any warnings.
