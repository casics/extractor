# Java Sorting (and Searching) Algorithms

Includes implementations of some well-known sorting (and a few searching) algorithms in _Java_. Currently it only sorts/searches primitive integer arrays. The whole thing was a little excercise for myself thus the algorithms are not documented (yet) and I cannot guarantee that they are completely bug-free ;).

## Implemented algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- [Insertion Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
- [Shell Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) (Using the _Ciura_ gap sequence)
- [Bubble Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

### Searching Algorithms
- [Linear Search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_search)
- [Binary Search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
